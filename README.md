PROBLEM STATEMENT: Segmenting and classifying skin lesions is part of the task. The objective is to create a model that can precisely identify and categorize skin lesions from photos.	

APPROACH: The method uses a methodical workflow to address the segmentation and classification problem of skin lesions. It begins with data preprocessing and ends with the training and assessment of segmentation and classification models.

To enable effective training, the first step entails loading the dataset from the designated path, obtaining ground truth data from the "GroundTruth.csv" file, and sampling a reasonable subset of 500 data points. The train_test_split function from scikit-learn is then used to divide the dataset into training and validation sets.

The dataset structure is used to create paths to images and masks, and Keras utilities are used to preprocess the images. To accomplish this, use load_img to load the photos, then convert them to NumPy arrays and normalize the pixel values to fall within [0, 1]. Masks are loaded in grayscale mode and normalized to the same range simultaneously.

A well-known framework for image segmentation tasks, U-Net architecture, is used by the segmentation model. It is made up of an encoder-decoder architecture. ReLU activation,'same' padding, and two convolutional layers with 32 filters each are all included in the encoder. For downsampling, max pooling with a pool size of (2, 2) is used. Upsampling layers are used on the decoder side to reconstruct the image, and the segmentation mask is then produced using a convolutional layer with sigmoid activation. The Adam optimizer is used to compile the segmentation model, and MeanIoU is used as the evaluation metric and binary crossentropy as the loss function. The model is trained with a batch size of 16 over ten epochs.

The fundamental model for lesion classification is an EfficientNetB0 architecture. To minimize spatial dimensions, global average pooling is used, and for multi-class classification, a dense layer with softmax activation is appended. The evaluation metrics for the classification model include categorical accuracy, categorical crossentropy loss, and the Adam optimizer. Like the segmentation model, it is trained with a batch size of 16 across 10 epochs.

On the validation set, the segmentation model is evaluated using the Jaccard Index, while the classification model is evaluated using metrics for loss and accuracy. Furthermore, preprocessed and imported test data is used for segmentation and classification tasks. Lesion categories on the test set are predicted by the classification model, whereas lesion masks are predicted by the segmentation model. This dual-model technique combines segmentation and classification skills to offer a comprehensive solution for precise skin lesion analysis.
